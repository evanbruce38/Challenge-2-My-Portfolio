# Challenge 2 My Portfolio

This project was the Second challenge for coding bootcamp. For this challenge I constructed a portfolio website from scratch. I will use this page as my portfolio for future projects going forward. I hope to continue to build on this page as I finish work in coding bootcamp, enjoy!
